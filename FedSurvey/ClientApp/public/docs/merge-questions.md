There are instances where a question may slightly change wording
from one year to the text, but conceptually, the question is the same.
For example, in 2016 the FEVS survey included the question
"I know how my work relates to the agency's goals and priorities."
Then, in 2018, the question changed to,
"I know how my work relates to the agency's goals."
There is a case to be made that these differences in text mean
differences in meaning, but there is also a case to be made
that these are conceptually the same question.
So, the software allows treating multiple bodies of text as the
same question when it is desired.

After a successful upload, go into the Admin panel and click "Merge Questions".
Because there are so many questions, the software does not list out all questions
for you to peruse.
Instead, the software gives you a dropdown in which you can start typing a question
to search and a list of merge candidates.

Merge candidates are defined as questions that have only appeared in one year
of surveys.
These are merge candidates because, in the above FEVS question example, figure
you have 2016 and 2017 uploaded and are now uploading 2018.
The new wording of the question will not be linked to anything previous, but
other questions across the survey that did not change wording will.
So, this is a way to filter down the questions to list into only those that could
be conceptually the same as past questions.

Now, there is also the case a merge candidate will simply be a new question on the survey.
In this case, the new question *will* be a merge candidate, but it can simply be left on the list.
The merge candidates list is not at all a requirement of items to take action upon;
it is simply a list that could help you as you seek to find questions that should be merged.
After all, in the first paragraph example, you entirely could see the two questions
that were presented as not conceptually the same.
Merging is up to you.

The software does not provide an interface for looking through past questions
to merge with on the merge questions page.
There is the dropdown that lets you type to search, but you can not look at
the survey and past surveys question-by-question.
In order to do this, I would recommend having the history tab from the main
page open.
It will allow you to see questions year-over-year in order to see if there
are any in the previous year that are similar enough.

Once you have determined which questions you would like to merge, put
them into the dropdown, likely by typing to search.
Once multiple questions are selected, click "Merge" and they will be merged.
If you have trouble with the dropdown and need to reset, click "Reset" at the
bottom and all will revert to normal.
In the future, both bodies of text of merged questions will result in
data being attached to the same question.
The software will try to always show the latest chronological text
as the question text.
