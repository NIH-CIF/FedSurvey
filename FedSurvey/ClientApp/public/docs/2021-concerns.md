There are a few concerns when it comes to FEVS data in 2021.
The NIH has been working toward establishing a solution to provide to all offices for survey visualization, which is EVS ART.
In picking this as their solution, the NIH has moved toward stopping providing raw data to the offices as they used to.
EVS ART	is not consistent in how it presents data whatsoever, so it cannot be uploaded into this system.
There are a couple scenarios in how 2021 data could be provided.

If 2021 data is only provided as EVS ART, who provides it will need to be asked about if there is any raw data file available.
If there is, that file will likely be of either the FEVS format or the New format and it can be uploaded.
If it is an entirely new format, it will have to be put into the old formats to be uploaded unless someone writes a handler for it.
If no raw data file can be provided, the EVS ART table will need to be copied into the old formats in order to be uploaded.
It is possible the EVS ART raw data section will allow for a simple copy and paste.

Long term, the NIH needs to be convinced that raw data should be provided to all offices so that they can do what they want with it.
That would allow a tool like this to continue to grow and to use this data easily.
In fact, if this tool does prove better than EVS ART, it could possibly replace it.
