There are instances where you may want to create an organization
whose data is the sum of other organizations.
For example, at OSC we collect data on our federal employees and
our contractors.
We want to be able to view these data sets separately and together.
For this purpose, we would have three organizations:
OFC STRATEGIC COORDINATION, the federal employees provided by FEVS;
OSC CON, the contractors;
OSC TOTAL, the federal employees and the contractors.
The software provides a way to configure an organization to where
its data will always be the sum of existing groups.
That will extend into the past and future.

After a successful upload, go into the Admin panel and click "Create Computed Organization".
This will bring you to a text box followed by a list of all organizations within the database with
checkboxes to the left of each organization.
First, you will need to insert the name of the new computed group into the text box.
Then, you will need to check each organization that this new one will include.
If you check a box that you did not mean to, click "Reset" and all naming and selections
will be undone.

Once this is complete, click "Create" and then the sum of the data will belong to the new
organization into the past.
Whenever a new piece of data is uploaded for any of the organizations that sum to the new
organization, the computed organization will automatically include that data.

The computed organization uses total response counts in order to calculate the new percentage.
In other words, if an organization of 10 people was 90% positive on a question, and a second
organization of 5 people was 80% positive on a question, the resulting percentage would be
13/15 = 86.7%.
The percentage would not be the average of the percentages, 85%.
To average percentages of multiple organizations, use the analysis feature.
