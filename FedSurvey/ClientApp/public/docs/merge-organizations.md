There are instances where the same organization will be spelled in multiple ways.
For example, the NIH may at one point be spelled "National Institutes of Health"
and at another time be spelled "NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH)".
In the 2016 FEVS data provided to OSC, the organization is "National Institutes of Health".
Then, in 2018, it switches to "NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH)".
In 2019 it switches back to "National Institutes of Health".
Because the upload process uses exact text matching in order to link organizations,
these two different spellings would initially be treated as two separate entities.
But there is a way to configure the software to treat both of these blocks
of text as the same organization in the past and into the future.

After a successful upload, go into the Admin panel and click "Merge Organizations".
This will bring you to a list of all organizations within the database with
checkboxes to the left of each organization.
When two organizations are treated as the same, you will have to pick the name
that you would like the resulting organization to have.
This will be deemed the first organization that is checked from the checkbox list.
So, check the box next to the organization that you would like to retain its name
and then proceed to check boxes of the other organizations that should be deemed
the same as the first organization.
If you check a box that you did not mean to, click "Reset" and all selections
will be undone.

Once this is complete, click "Merge" and then the data will belong to the same
organization into the past.
In future uploads, both of the pieces of text will now be attached to the same
organization.
