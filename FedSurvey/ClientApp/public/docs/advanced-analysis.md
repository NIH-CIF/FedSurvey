Survey Data Aggregator allows an analysis view that allows you to create a data table targeting
exactly what you are interested in finding within the survey data.
To get to this view, click on "Advanced" from the homepage.

Setting up the data table is done in three steps.

First, you need to set what variable you want going across your table
and what variable you want going down your table.
These are variables that you will want to see multiple of at the same time.

Next, you will set values for the two variables that you did not select above.
I generally call these locked variables.
Because a table is two-dimensional but each piece of data is effectively attached
to four dimensions, we need to set two variables to always have the same value across
the entire table.
If we are seeing organization across and response down, we have to select a single year
to view and a single question to view.

Once the locked variables are set, data will appear.
This table could be rather daunting at first though, as it will show all data existing
within the database.
To make things a bit simpler, the variables going across and down the table can be filtered
to only show certain values.
This is done using a dropdown that allows you to select multiple options that allows you
to type to search.
Now, you can shrink your table to only what you want to focus on.

Do not forget that the data can always be exported to Excel using the Export button in the top right!
